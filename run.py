# This file is the main runner script for examples ran via the command line.
#
# It picks up the arguments from the command line and
# calls the algorithm on the specified circuit with hyperparameters from run_hyperparams.py.
#
# The file is compatible with any graph in the folder `./assets/graphs`,
# but the graph needs to exist in either `assets/graphs/simple_graphs.py` or `assets/graphs/pyzx_graphs.py`

# MAIN RUN MANAGER #

def run():
    """Runs algorithm when prompted from command line, using args given in command.

    Args (function does not take args directly, but args below can be given to it via the command):
        - `--graph:<name_of_graph>`: name of the graph in `./assets/graphs/simple_graphs.py` to run.
        - `--pyzx:<name_of_pyzx_graph>`: name of the graph in `./assets/graphs/pyzx_graphs.py` to run.
        - `--strip_boundaries`: instructs the algorithm to eliminate any boundary nodes and their corresponding edges
                (without it, nodes are factored into the process and shown on visualisation).
        - `--hide_boundaries`: instructs the algorithm to use boundary nodes but do not display them in visualisation
                (without it, nodes are factored into the process and shown on visualisation).

    Returns:
        - n/a. All outputs below result from separate functions at different parts of the process.
            - Pops up an interactive 3D viewer for user to examine the space-time diagram produced as output.
            - Saves a TXT file with detailed results to `.outputs/txt/` folder.
            - Saves a GIF or MP4 animation to `.outputs/media/` folder.
            - IMPORTANT! This is NOT the function you need to use any of the above programmatically â€“ see `./scripts/runner.py` for that.
